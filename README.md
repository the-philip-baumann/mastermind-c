# Mastermind Game (C)

A simple implementation of the **Mastermind** game in C.

## Game Rules:

1. The solution consists of **4 colors** (can be configured) randomly chosen from a set of **8 colors**.
2. The player has **12 rounds** (can be configured) to guess the correct solution.
3. After each guess, the player receives feedback:
   - **Correct color and position**: Number of colors that are correct in both color and position.
   - **Correct color but wrong position**: Number of colors that are correct in color but not in position.
4. The game ends when:
   - The player guesses the correct solution, or
   - The player runs out of rounds.
   
Good luck guessing the code!
